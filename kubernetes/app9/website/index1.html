    <div>Plain language focuses on ways of writing a text so that it is clear, concise, pertinent, efficient, and flows well for the reader.[4] The Center for Plain Language states that: "[a] document, web site or other information is in plain language if the target audience can read it, understand what they read, and confidently act on it".[5] Writing in plain language does not mean oversimplifying the concepts, but presenting the information in a way that makes it easier to understand and use by a wider audience.[6] Texts written in plain language are still formal, but are easier to read and inspire confidence for the reader.[7]</div>
